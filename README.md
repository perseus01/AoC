# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to each Advent of Code puzzle. Currently, all solutions are in python, but I may add solutions using different programming languages later.

All solutions prioritize completion.

The current file structure of the repository is as below:

```
${year}
|-- ${day}
    |-- ${day}-${part}.py
    |-- ${day}_input.txt
```
